tower
- 1 face down card for each player
- 1 card in middle of table
- when ready, each player flips card
- whoever matches first puts the card on top of their current one, thus drawing a new card
  - the succesful matcher should have a delay created by the animation of pulling the card from center to theirs. artificial delay is ok too
- the game continues until all cards are drawn, and the winner is the person with the most cards

well
- deal all cards evenly to players
- one face up card in middle
- players flip cards from their piles and match with the middle
- first player to lose all their cards wins

hotPotato
- all players get one card face down
- everyone flips at same time
- if a player finds a match, they give their card to their opponent
- the player with 2 cards now needs to find a match between their new card and everyone else's card
- this repeats until someone is given all the cards and they lose the round
- loser sets aside those cards
- everyone gets new cards face down
- player with most cards when deck is empty loses


badApple
- deal everyone 1 card
- rest of cards face up in center
- everyone flips at same time
- if you spot a match between the center and an opponents card, place the center card on opponent's card, thus drawing a new card and giving opponent a new card
- player with least cards when deck is empty wins
